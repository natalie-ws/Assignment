    <p><h3>My experience of learning</h3>  I very much enjoyed my experience of learning the basics of web development. It's good to be able to instantly see what you are working on and how it all comes together. There was a couple of times where I got stuck, most of the time a quick google search and it was easy to figure out where I had gone wrong or what I needed to do, but there were a couple of times where due to the "current circumstances" an easy fix which should have only taken minutes, if not seconds became a mammoth task - one of which was knowing what powershift is, really simple now that I know but at the time it took me hours to find out (google has very different answers). When I look back at the class videos it does explain it, but at the time I thought it was some super secret program that I had no idea about! <br>
   <br> I have found coding becomes easier the more you are doing it, once you have found out something once, it's very easy to find and do again.<br>
 <br>Designing the webpage was fun, I used the website suggested for the colours (colourlovers), I first wrote out the content of the first four pages and then went on the website and had a play about using different colours before landing on the current colour scheme. For the fonts, I used google fonts, I did try out some fancy scripted ones to begin with but it didn't look right for a website, so I stuck to some basic, common fonts. <br>
<br>I was dreading the debugging side of the website design, however, because I did it after each time I did something new, it actually wasn't that bad, the website (w3csmarkup) is saved as a tab on my browser and it explains things quite well to know what you have done wrong - plus there's no greater joy that it turning green!
<h3>Module experience</h3>Overall this was probably my favourite module, I enjoyed how the lectures were structured, and I found the quiz very helpful to remember the terms used in coding. <br><br> On a personal side of things last term was quite difficult for me, I suffered extreme morning sickness (day and night) and I have a 1 year old at home, so to find the time where I felt almost human to do the work was near on imposible, however, I managed to take good notes each week on the lessons and as the lessons are also online, they are good to refer back to. Next term should be a breaze after this one. </p>

<h2>Site Development</h2>
<p>I made quite a few changes to the overall design, one of which was to add an intro section to all of the pages to make them look more informed.</p>
